# HATCHFOUR
Hatchfour is a "dinosaur-themed" take on the classic Connect4 game. Hatchfour is a 2-person game, where the players take turn to try and hatch their dinosaurs to create 4 in a row! A player can win by getting 4 of their dinosaur in a row: horizonatally, vertically, or diagonally. Once the game is over by either a win or tie, it can be reset by selecting the 'Play Again' button.
