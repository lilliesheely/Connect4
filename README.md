# HATCHFOUR
Hatchfour is a "dinosaur-themed" take on the classic Connect4 game. It is a 2-person game, where the each player takes a turn to try and hatch 4 of their dinosaurs in a row! A player can win by getting 4 of their dinosaurs in a row: horizonatally, vertically, or diagonally. Once the game is over, with a win or a tie, it can be reset by selecting the 'Play Again' button.

## Getting Started
Click below to play! Decide who wants to be the T-Rex and who wants to be the Stegosaurus. T-Rex goes first! Tap on the down arrows above the eggs to select the column you want your dinosaur to hatch. Dinos will hatch from the bottom up!

## Next Steps
- [ ] Create a scoreboard for T-Rex wins & Stegosaurus wins
- [ ] Create a more obvious "winner" experience
- [ ] Automatically show a tie when there no longer an option to win (before the board is filled up)
- [ ] Create a second theme for a minimalist look & be able to toggle between either
